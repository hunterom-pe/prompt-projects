# Prompt Engineering – AI That Works

## Welcome

This is my collection of real-world prompt engineering projects designed to show how AI can improve productivity, clarity, and efficiency across teams, whether you're in QA, marketing, finance, support, or beyond.

My name is **Hunter Ortega-Mathews**, and after 12 years working in tech as a Senior Lead QA, I’ve shifted my focus to **prompt engineering**—the art of crafting effective instructions for large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.

This repo is both my portfolio and proof of prompt AI. It demonstrates how thoughtful, detailed prompt designs can solve problems, automate workflows, reduce worktime, and support teams in meaningful ways.

## What Is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the skill of writing structured, precise, and goal-driven inputs to guide AI models to produce a high-quality, useful output.

In simpler terms:
> **It's how you talk to AI to get the results you actually need.**

Great prompts don’t just “ask questions.” They:
- Guide the tone, structure, and depth
- Anticipate edge cases and covers layers of thought
- Deliver consistent, reliable output
- Transform vague ideas into usable results

## Why Companies Care

Prompt engineering has massive potential to:
- Save hours of manual work
- Improve the quality of documentation, content, and planning
- Assist teams without technical AI skills
- Scale creative, technical, and operational tasks

Even without coding, prompt engineers can:
- Help QA teams write test plans and edge cases
- Assist marketing with blog posts, scripts, or social content
- Support customer success teams with faster ticket summaries
- Guide financial advisors to generate client-facing content
- Build AI-driven workflows that reduce bottlenecks across any department

## What You'll Find in This Repo

Each folder contains a themed project using AI to solve a real-world business challenge. Every project includes:

- A clear use case
- The prompts that drive the result
- The input and structured output
- Notes and lessons learned

### ✅ Examples:

| Folder                     | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| `test-prompts/`            | Generate test cases, bug  reports, and QA test plans |
| `youtube-script-generator/`| Create video scripts for real estate, finance, and marketing teams |
| `coming-soon/`             | More use cases for email generation, onboarding flows, content QA, and more |

Each one shows how prompt engineering isn’t just a “cool AI trick”—it’s a tool for **practical business results**.
