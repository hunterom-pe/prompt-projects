# Prompt Projects – AI That Works

## 👋 Welcome

This is a collection of real-world prompt engineering projects designed to show how AI can improve productivity, clarity, and efficiency across teams—whether you're in QA, marketing, finance, support, or beyond.

My name is **Hunter Ortega-Mathews**, and after 12 years working in tech as a Senior Lead QA, I’ve shifted my focus to **prompt engineering**—the art of crafting effective instructions for large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.

This repo is both a portfolio and a proof-of-concept. It demonstrates how thoughtful prompt design can solve problems, automate workflows, and support teams in meaningful ways—*without needing to write a single line of code*.

## 🧠 What Is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the skill of writing structured, precise, and goal-driven input to guide AI models to produce high-quality output.

In simpler terms:
> **It's how you talk to AI to get the results you actually need.**

Great prompts don’t just “ask questions.” They:
- Guide the model's tone, structure, and depth
- Anticipate edge cases and clarify ambiguous input
- Deliver consistent, reliable output
- Transform vague ideas into usable results

## 🏢 Why Companies Care

Prompt engineering has massive potential to:
- Save hours of manual work
- Improve the quality of documentation, content, and planning
- Assist teams without technical AI skills
- Scale creative, technical, and operational tasks

Even without coding, prompt engineers can:
- Help QA teams write test plans and edge cases
- Assist marketing with blog posts, scripts, or social content
- Support customer success teams with faster ticket summaries
- Guide financial advisors to generate client-facing content
- Build AI-driven workflows that reduce bottlenecks across any department

- 🧩 Notes and lessons learned

### ✅ Examples:

| Folder                     | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| `test-prompts/`            | Generate test cases, bug triage reports, and QA test plans |
| `youtube-script-generator/`| Create video scripts for real estate, finance, and marketing teams |
| `coming-soon/`             | More use cases for email generation, onboarding flows, content QA, and more |

Each one shows how prompt engineering isn’t just a “cool AI trick”—it’s a tool for **practical business results**.
