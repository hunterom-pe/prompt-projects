# Notes on Prompt V1

- Output structure was consistent and easy to read
- Prompt handled platform/version nuance well (iOS 16.1 vs 16.4)
- Did not suggest possible regression link to last release—may refine prompt to ask for cause suggestions
- Will improve prompt to:
  - Detect time-based clues (“since last Thursday's release”)
  - Flag potential duplicates if other context is available
