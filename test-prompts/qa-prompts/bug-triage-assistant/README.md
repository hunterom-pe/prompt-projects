# Bug Triage Assistant (Prompt Engineering)

This prompt experiment explores the use of AI to summarize and structure raw bug reports for QA triage.

## Objective

Given a messy or unstructured bug description (like one from a user or tester), the AI should:
- Extract key details (summary, reproduction steps, device/browser info)
- Estimate severity and priority
- Suggest potential causes or related tickets
- Output in a consistent format usable for Jira or QA syncs

## Prompt Versions
- `prompt-v1.md`: First structured attempt
- `output-v1.md`: Raw result from the model
- `notes.md`: Reflection on effectiveness and prompt iteration ideas
