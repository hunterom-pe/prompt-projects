# Notes â€“ Prompt V1 Review

- Tone was strong. Flt like a real advisor talking to concerned clients
- Covered all three major points without sounding robotic or overly optimistic
- Would improve by including:
  - Optional visuals or B-roll cues (charts, photos of people planning retirement)
  - Personalized intro (mentioning the advisor's city or experience)
