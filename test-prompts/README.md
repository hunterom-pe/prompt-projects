# Test-Prompts: AI-Assisted QA with Prompt Engineering

## 🧠 What Is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the skill of crafting precise, effective instructions for AI models (like ChatGPT or Claude) to generate useful, high-quality output. In a QA context, that means guiding the AI to:

- Generate test cases from user stories or acceptance criteria
- Draft full test plans with minimal input
- Analyze bug reports and structure them for triage
- Identify edge cases and hidden test scenarios
- Help QA teams move faster and cover more ground

Prompt engineering doesn’t replace QA—it **enhances and supports it**.

## 🧪 Why This Matters for QA Teams

In most companies, QA teams spend a significant amount of time writing documentation, structuring test cases, and formatting reports. These are important tasks—but they’re also repetitive and time-consuming.

This project demonstrates how AI can:

- 📄 **Auto-generate test plans and documentation**
- ⚠️ **Triage bug reports and suggest priorities**
- 🧪 **Generate edge case scenarios on demand**
- 🕒 **Reduce test planning time by up to 50%**
- 👥 **Standardize output across distributed teams**

When done right, prompt engineering helps teams:
- Ship faster
- Test smarter
- Maintain quality under tight deadlines

## 📂 What This Folder Contains

This folder contains examples of how prompt engineering can be used in real-world QA workflows. Each subfolder explores a specific use case:

- `login-prompt/` → Turn basic acceptance criteria into full test cases
- `test-plan-generator/` → Create a complete test plan outline
- `bug-triage-assistant/` → Analyze unstructured bug reports and organize them for triage

Each example includes:
- The original prompt (`prompt-v1.md`)
- The sample input (`sample-input.md`)
- The output generated by the AI (`output-v1.md`)
- Notes on what worked and how to improve the prompt (`notes.md`)

## 💼 Why I’m Building This

I’ve worked in tech as a manual QA for 12 years—most recently as a Senior Lead QA. I’ve seen how much time is spent on planning, formatting, and documentation.

I built this project to show how I can apply prompt engineering to modernize QA practices and bring *real, immediate value* to teams—especially those working in fast-paced or AI-forward environments.

## 🔧 How You Could Use Me

I can help your team:
- Integrate AI tooling into existing QA workflows
- Create internal prompt libraries for test generation and bug triage
- Automate documentation for devs, PMs, and QA leads
- Reduce manual overhead while increasing test clarity and coverage

If your company is exploring how AI can improve development, testing, or delivery—this is a smart, practical place to start.

Let’s build better testing, faster.
