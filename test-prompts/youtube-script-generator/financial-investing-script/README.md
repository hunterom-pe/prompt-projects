# YouTube Script: Financial Investing During Uncertain Markets

This prompt project simulates how an AI-powered script generator could assist a holistic financial advisor in creating a clear, reassuring 2â€“3 minute video for clients 40+ years old.

## Goal

The video aims to reassure clients that, despite recent stock market volatility, continuing to invest is still a smart long-term strategy. The tone is calm, friendly, and supportive.
