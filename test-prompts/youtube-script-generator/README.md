# YouTube Script Generator (Prompt Project)

This project explores prompt engineering for structured, human-sounding YouTube video scripts. The goal is to guide an LLM to produce a 2–3 minute explainer video, complete with timestamped segments, a clear intro, helpful information, and a warm closing.

## Use Case

This script targets potential homebuyers who are hesitant due to high interest rates or a soft housing market. The tone is friendly, confident, and informative—ideal for real estate agents or home lending professionals looking to educate and reassure.
